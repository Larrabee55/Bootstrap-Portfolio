        My name is Cameron and I am 20 years old. I grew up in Utah and ahave lived here for my whole life. I
        graduated from Taylorsville high school in 2016 and have been attending Salt lake Community college since
        then! I am currently working full time as a leasing agent and a student in the University of Utah coding
        bootcamp. My goal after this bootcamp is get a good career in computer science. I will start by getting a
        job in web development and will continue to go to school so I can learn as much as I can about computer
        science and advance up to a computer engineer or software engineer.

        I enjoy many things such as playing video games, riding my motorcycle, and being outside in the sun. I play
        many gmaes such as League of Legends, Player Unknown Battle Grounds, and Super Smash Bros. I own a 2007
        Honda CBR 600CC and enjoy riding on nice sunny days. I really enjoy taking it up the canyons.
